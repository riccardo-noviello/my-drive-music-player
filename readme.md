# My Drive music player #

This is a mini project I have done in Nov 2018 in about a week. It's a React Native MP3 player streaming from my Google Drive via Open ID authentication.

There was also a Spring Boot backend acting in the middle to serve the mp3s, which had gone lost. I hope I will be able to rewrite it soon.
